    - The idea is to collect information for all countries of the world about the health status of the country
    - since it was exposed to the virus and the number of infections and deaths from it.
    - we'll collect data through web scraping and designing GUI to facilitate the process for users
      And make comparisons and analyze this information and make comparisons and print reports about each country using
      the tools available to us and more.
  - What problem or pain point does it solve?
    - Through this idea, analyzing the data of each country and strategies for dealing with the problem of Corona
      we will develop excellent plans
    - solutions and ways to deal with the upcoming pandemics and how to preserve people's lives and a healthy planet
  - Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition.
  -What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
    - We need libraries as:
      - Tkinter to make the GUI
      - pandas to make a data frame
      - numpy to deal with arrays
      - matplotlib to do some data visualization and analysis
      - requests to deal with api
