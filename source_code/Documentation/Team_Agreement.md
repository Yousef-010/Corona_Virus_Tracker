  - so the hard work will seem effortless.
- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - We all agreed that we want to make our best to develop in the python field. since
  we are all new to this field we want to get the best to do the libraries

how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

## Conflict Plan

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - By identifying points of agreement and disagreement, working on each conflict
  one by one
  - dividing the tasks in the team as appropriate
  - and assigning people to work more in the event that one of the team members is
  absent from his duties
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting
the other members contribute?
  - In such case we agreed to adress the problem on whatsapp in a professional way
  - we will explain to him that each person in the team is an asset and can contribute,
  we should all work together to reach our project's goal
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing
that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding
and skill level?
  - The tasks will be divided on what we agree is the key strength for each person,
  and the problems will work on them together
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - By dealing with him individually on WhatsApp and clarifying the goal and the
  general idea of the team
  - and making it clear that this is an opportunity to gain mutual experiences from
  each other to reach the main goal and complete the project
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  - it is rare to have such case
  - but if this happened then the best practice would be to reach out our Instructor
  or one of the TA\s each member will address it in his own words
  - and we will find the best solution that serves our project goals and vision.
